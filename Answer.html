<p>A close friend of yours works as a freelance copy typist,
working at home, for one of the Business<br>
Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies in Korea. Every Saturday
evening, this friend receives copy-<br>
typing projects of various sizes, typically 50 to 500 pages of
copy-typing work, some of which she must<br>
complete and submit back immediately.</p>
<p>To help her manage, you decided to write a program that would
schedule the copy-typing projects she<br>
receives. In this program, you will input the details of each
project that arrives and store this<br>
information in a text file. Only copy-typing projects with
information in this text file will be scheduled<br>
for copy-typing by placing them in a queue. You decided to apply
the priority scheduling protocol and<br>
therefore place the project that must be completed immediately in
the front of the queue and the<br>
project that may be delayed at the rear. Following is the general
outline of your algorithm:</p>
<p>1. Input the copy-typing projects, with their size (number of
pages) and priority information (the<br>
lower the number, the higher the priority) into the text
file.<br>
2. In a queue, sort the projects according to priority. If two
projects has equal priority, then sort<br>
according to size, in ascending order (shortest-job first).<br>
3. Apply first-come-first-served algorithm by getting the project
from the front of the queue<br>
working until the one at the rear is completed.<br>
Your task, therefore, is to design, implement, and test the program
just described using Python<br>
Programming Language.</p>
<button class="block">Answer</button><hr>
<p>For constructing this program we will take the help of the priority queue (heap) We will use priority as the first parameter to sort and size as the second parameter to sort.</p>

<code class="language-python">from heapq import heappush,heappop ,heapify

#initalizing heap for storing the task
heap = []
heapify(heap)
while True :
    print("Enter the details for the copy typing project ")
    size = float(input("Enter the size of the project : "))
    priority = int(input("Enter the priority of the project : "))

    #push the details into the heap
    heappush(heap,(priority,size))

    choice = input("Do you want to add more projects : ")
    #if don;t want to add more details
    if choice.upper() == "N":
        break

#now printing the details of the project details
while heap :
    priority,size = heappop(heap)
    print(f"You have to complete the project of {size} size and {priority} priority")
